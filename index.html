	<h1>PIAP.com</h1>
	<p>Welcome to PIAP.com the old style is back. A long time ago I created this website
	by hand with a text editor and a little knowledge of HTML. There was no CSS then and 
	<blink>blinking</blink> text was common. Over time my methods of generating web pages
	evolved to desktop applications that generated the HTML I would push to the server
	and then to server based web applications (content management systems) which allowed
	me to do everything from a web browser anywhere in the world. Over that time the web
	changed a lot too. To put it simply, then it was personal, now it is corporate.</p>
	<p>I'm returning PIAP.com to the old style of hand written HTML pages and scaling back
	the content greatly.</p>
